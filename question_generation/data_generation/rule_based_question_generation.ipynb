    "The commands here execute [Hielman & Smith's question generation system](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/mheilman/questions/), which uses rule-based transformations to syntactic parse trees to derive questions from sentences, where each question has an answer contained in the transformed sentence. Additionally, the approach scores the generated questions based on a statistical model of quality. The result of the code here is a dataset with input sentence and question pairs (answers highlighted in the input sentence) along with their scores.\n",
